# Music-Generator-Website
## Introduction
I first started this project because I was interested in machine learning and after a couple of months, I started to get into neural networks. I was looking for some cool neural network projects and came accross a music generator. I mainly followed a tutorial from towardsdatascience to get a good grasp on neural networks and how they work. I also tried implimenting some of my own stuff to what the tutorial had.
## Music Generator
I used tensorflow and python3 to complete this project. I first got some midi files and used the pretty midi library to manipulate the midi files. I only used midi files that only had one instrument which was the Piano. Once I extracted the notes, I had to create a tokenizer to change the notes into indexes of the notes.  
Next came training the model. I used 3 layers of GRU and some self attention layers. I also used some dropouts so the neural network wouldn't overfit too much. To update the weight of the neural network I iterated through some of the music in the dataset and then took a number of those instances into a batch to be the input and target of the nueral network using GradientTape. First I calculate the loss and apply the back propagation to it. Once I had the model, it was time to actually use it and generate some music. I tried two different ways to generate it. I would start with 50 random notes or use 49 empty notes followed by a note of our choice. But besides the start, it generates notes the same after. It would predict the next note based on the 50 random notes. It would keep predicting notes until the desired length is reached. After we have all the notes, the next step would be to change it back into a PrettyMidi object and write it to a .mid file so we can listen to it. However, with the website I choose to just include the one that starts with 50 random notes becaause I those sounded better.
## Website
I first start off with angular because that is what I was learning from my internship. But then I thought it would be cool to modify it to include my music generator code. Once you click on the generate button, a download of the .mid file should start and you'll be able to listn to the file once it's down downloading. However, I discovered that you can't have python code run in angular. That's when I discovered flask, and a way to use angular in flask. However, there was a small problem with the way I was doing this because flask doesn't connect to angular. What I mean by this is that you have to build the angular code and transport it to a specific folder that flask looks for. So all the logic and stuff is there but I didn't see a way to connect the button that you click to generate music in angular to flask. So I had to add in a flask button to the html code which made it a bit messy because now that button appears on every page because flask only looks for the index.html in the templates folder. The index.html is what holds the angular code, so by writting in the button to index.html instead of in angular. The button appears on every page.  
## Future
If I have more time in the future, I would like to add in other instruments and information pages. I would also like to add in multiple instruments instead of just one instrument.
